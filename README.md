\# Flight Routing Optimization with Maintenance Constraints



\## General



The script `main.m`, that is in the root directory of this repository, execute the simulation.



It will produce among others the material presented in the article by using the excell files in the folder DATOS\_EXCELL as input data.



The simulation code in this repository was tested in the following environment:

\* \*Windows 10\* Version 21H1

\* \*Matlab\* 2024a
